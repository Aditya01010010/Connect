## About

## Build 
    HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript
    Node.js, Express.js
    WebRTC
    Socket.io
    peerjs
    uuidv4

## Other Frameworks

## Constraints

## Instructions 
    After downloading the code, open a new terminal and run the following commands:
        1.	node app
        2.	peerjs --port 3001
    This starts the website on localhost:3000 and sets up peerjs for use as well.
